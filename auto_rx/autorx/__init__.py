# Now using Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)  MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
# MAJOR - Only updated when something huge changes to the project (new decode chain, etc)
# MINOR - New sonde type support, other fairly big changes that may result in telemetry or config file incompatability issus.
# PATCH - Small changes, or minor feature additions.

#       'task' (class)  : If this SDR is in use, a reference to the task.
#       'bias' (bool)   : True if the bias-tee should be enabled on this SDR, False otherwise.
#       'ppm' (int)     : The PPM offset for this SDR.
#       'gain' (float)  : The gain setting to use with this SDR. A setting of -1 turns on hardware AGC.
