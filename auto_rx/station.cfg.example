#	i.e. to set the serial number of a (single) connected RTLSDR: rtl_eeprom -s 00000002
#	Then set the device_idx below to 00000002, and repeat for the other [sdr_n] sections below
#
#   For the special case when auto_rx is used entirely with a JSON-via-UDP input, set the below to TCP001

# Settings for uploading to radiosondy.info
#
# IMPORTANT APRS NOTE
#
# As of auto_rx version 1.5.10, we are limiting APRS output to only radiosondy.info,
# and only on the non-forwarding port. 
# This decision was not made lightly, and is a result of the considerable amount of
# non-amateur traffic that radiosonde flights are causing within the APRS-IS network.
# Until some form of common format can be agreed to amongst the developers of *all* 
# radiosonde tracking software to enable radiosonde telemetry to be de-duped, 
# I have decided to help reduce the impact on the wider APRS-IS network by restricting 
# the allowed servers and ports.
# If you are using another APRS-IS server that *does not* forward to the wider APRS-IS
# network and want it allowed, then please raise an issue at
# https://github.com/projecthorus/radiosonde_auto_rx/issues
#
# You are of course free to fork and modify this codebase as you wish, but please be aware
# that this goes against the wishes of the radiosonde_auto_rx developers to not be part
# of the bigger problem of APRS-IS congestion. 
# As of 2022-03-01, radiosonde traffic has been filtered from aprs.fi, so even if you do
# modify the code, you still won't see sondes on that map.
# APRS-IS is a *shared resource*, intended for the use of all amateur radio operators, and 
# for many years we have been treating it as a playground to dump large amounts of non-amateur
# traffic into, so we can see weather balloons on a map. 
# Instead of congesting this shared resource with this non-amateur traffic, we should instead
# be moving to using databases and sites specialised for this purpose, for example sondehub.org
