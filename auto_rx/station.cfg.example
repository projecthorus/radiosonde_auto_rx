# Device Index / Serial
#	If using a single RTLSDR, set this value to 0

#	i.e. to set the serial number of a (single) connected RTLSDR: rtl_eeprom -s 00000002

# SDR Gain Setting
#   Gain settings can generally range between 0dB and 40dB depending on the tuner in use.
#   Run rtl_test to confirm what gain settings are available, or use a value of -1 to use hardware automatic gain control (AGC).
#   Note that this is an overall gain value, not an individual mixer/tuner gain. This is a limitation of the rtl_power/rtl_fm utils.
